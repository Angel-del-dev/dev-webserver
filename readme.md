# Development web server

Simple to use, zero dependency development web server

# Download

Download the latest release, which will only be a single `.exe` file.

*To use the server globally, the path must be added manually to the environment variables*  

# Use

Open a terminal and navigate to the desired folder.  
Once there, write the path to the web server(or `dev` if it was previously added to the environment variables)  
The command **will** serve the current directory  
Example:
```bat
dev
```
 
# Configuration

The default port is 5500 

If this configuration needs to be changed, start the web server providing an additional argument  
Example:

```bat
dev 8080
```
